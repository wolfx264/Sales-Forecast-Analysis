# Sales-Forecast-Analysis
Data analysis and sales forecasting using a SARIMA model

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my skills in data visualization, data forcasting, and dashboard creation. The dataset I used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tanayatipre/store-sales-forecasting-dataset) at kaggle.com. It is a large dataset of a furniture company that has listed its sales records from 2014 to 2017. The dashboard, which is the culmination of this project, can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/travis.wolf1141/viz/DataForecastfor2018/Dashboard1#1) on Tableau Public.
