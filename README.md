# Sales-Forecast-Analysis
Data analysis and sales forecasting using a SARIMA model

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my skills in data visualization, data forcasting, and dashboard creation. The dataset I used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tanayatipre/store-sales-forecasting-dataset) at kaggle.com. The dashboard for this project can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/travis.wolf1141/viz/DataForecastfor2018/Dashboard1#1), on Tableau Public.

This project will be examining the data of a furniture company that has sales records from 2014 to 2017. Since sales have increased for the last three years, the company wants to have a forecasted projection of sales for the next twelve months.

I have assigned myself the following questions:
  1. Can we forecast the next twelve months of overall sales with our dataset?
  2. If we can, then what will be the forecasted sales be for each month?
  3. How will the forecasted sales compare to last year?
  4. By how much did sales increase for each year? How much are they forecasted to increase by next year?
