The purpose of this repository is to showcase my skills in data visualization, data forecasting, machine learning, and dashboard creation. This project will be examining the data of an unnamed furniture company that has sales records from 2014 to 2017. Since sales have increased for the last three years, the company wants to have a forecasted projection of sales for the next twelve months of 2018.

I have assigned myself the following questions:
  1. Can we forecast the next twelve months of 2018 sales with our dataset?
  2. If we can, then what will be the forecasted sales be for each month of 2018?
  3. How will the forecasted sales of 2018 compare to 2017?
  4. By how much did sales increase for each year? How much are they forecasted to increase by the end of 2018?
