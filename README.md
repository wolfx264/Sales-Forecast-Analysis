# Sales-Forecast-Analysis
Data analysis and sales forecasting using a SARIMA model

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my skills in data visualization, data forcasting, and dashboard creation. The dataset I used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tanayatipre/store-sales-forecasting-dataset) at kaggle.com. The dashboard, which is the culmination of this project, can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/travis.wolf1141/viz/DataForecastfor2018/Dashboard1#1) on Tableau Public.

The dataset I am using for this project is of a furniture company that has listed its sales records from 2014 to 2017
For this project I have assigned myself the following questions:
  1. Can we forecast the next twelve months of overall sales with our dataset?
  2. If we can, then what will be the forecasted sales for each month?
  3. How will the forecasted sales compare to last year?
  4. By how much did sales increase or decrease year by year?
